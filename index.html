    /* Instructions

    1. Before you can make any part of our site work, you need to create an array of strings, each one related to a topic that interests you. Save it to a variable called `topics`.

    2. Your app should take the topics in this array and create buttons in your HTML.
    * Try using a loop that appends a button for each string in the array.

    3. When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

    4. When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

    5. Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on).

    6. Add a form to your page takes the value from a user input box and adds it into your `topics` array. Then make a function call that takes each topic in the array and remakes the buttons on the page.*/

    $(document).ready(function() {
    // Create an array of moods for the user to choose their current mood from;
    var moods = ["Happy", "Sad", "Angry", "Scared", "Confused", "Bored", "Busy", "Crazy", "Anxious", "Proud", "Tired"];
    
    // Create a function that will iterate through our array of moods to generate the buttons which, when clicked, will summon relevant Gifs from the GIPHY API
    function createGifButtons(){
        // Erase previous content of the buttons display area
        $("#buttons-appear-here").empty();
        // Create a for loop to grab each mood in our array so that it can be assigned a bunch of data/style properties

    ### Bonus Goals

    1. Ensure your app is fully mobile responsive.

    2. Allow users to request additional gifs to be added to the page.
    * Each request should ADD 10 gifs to the page, NOT overwrite the existing gifs.

    3. List additional metadata (title, tags, etc) for each gif in a clean and readable format.

    4. Include a 1-click download button for each gif, this should work across device types.

    5. Integrate this search with additional APIs such as OMDB, or Bands in Town. Be creative and build something you are proud to showcase in your portfolio

    6. Allow users to add their favorite gifs to a `favorites` section.
    * This should persist even when they select or add a new topic.
    * If you are looking for a major challenge, look into making this section persist even when the page is reloaded(via localStorage or cookies).

    ### Reminder: Submission on BCS

    * Please submit both the deployed Github.io link to your homework AND the link to the Github Repository!
